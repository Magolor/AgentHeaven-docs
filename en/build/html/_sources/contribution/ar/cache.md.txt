# Cache - Allocated Requirements

This document outlines the requirements allocated to the Cache component within the AgentHeaven architecture.

## 1. Overview

The Cache component is responsible for monitoring and temporarily storing function calls, LLM interactions, and agent trajectories.

## 2. Allocated Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Implementation Details | Priority |
|----|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| FR-07 | Cache/Memory | Implements monitoring and storage of system I/O | High |
| FR-08 | Retrieval Engine | Provides cached data for retrieval methods | High |
| FR-27 | Cache Backend Types | Implements Disk, Json, In-Memory, Callback, and Database cache backends | High |
| FR-28 | Cache Entry Structure | Provides universal CacheEntry with func, inputs, output, and metadata | High |
| FR-29 | Cache Decorators | Supports memoize and batch_memoize decorators for functions | High |
| FR-30 | Async Support | Handles both synchronous and asynchronous function caching | High |
| FR-31 | Streaming Support | Caches streaming generator functions (sync and async) | High |
| FR-32 | Cache Annotation | Allows adding expected outputs and metadata to cache entries | Medium |
| FR-33 | Cache Exclusion | Supports excluding specific parameters from cache key generation | Medium |
| FR-34 | Cache Batch Operations | Provides efficient batch caching for multiple function calls | Medium |

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Implementation Details | Priority |
|----|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| NFR-01 | Performance | Implements caching for low-latency access | High |
| NFR-02 | Observability | Records all LLM interactions and agent actions | Medium |
| NFR-10 | Cache Hit Rate | Optimizes cache key generation for high hit rates | High |
| NFR-11 | Memory Management | Implements efficient memory usage for cache entries | High |
| NFR-12 | Thread Safety | Ensures cache operations are thread-safe | High |
| NFR-13 | Cache Persistence | Provides reliable persistence for disk and database caches | Medium |

<br/>

### 2.3 Cross-Component Dependencies

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| KLStore | For persisting cached data as UKF records |
| Agent | For monitoring agent trajectories |
| LLM | For capturing LLM inputs/outputs |
