# BaseUKF - Allocated Requirements

This document outlines the requirements allocated to the BaseUKF component within the AgentHeaven architecture.

## 1. Overview

BaseUKF (Unified Knowledge Format) serves as the foundation for knowledge representation in AgentHeaven. It defines the schema and serialization format for all knowledge artifacts.

<br/>

## 2. Allocated Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Implementation Details | Priority |
|----|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| FR-02 | Knowledge Management | Implements the core UKF schema and serialization | High |
| FR-05 | Prompt Templating | Stores prompt templates as UKF records | High |
| FR-19 | Built-in UKF Types | Implements KnowledgeUKFT, ExperienceUKFT, DocumentUKFT, and TemplateUKFT UKF types | High |
| FR-20 | UKF Versioning | Supports semantic versioning and derived knowledge items | High |
| FR-21 | UKF Tagging System | Provides structured tagging with slot:value format and filtering | High |
| FR-22 | UKF Relationship Modeling | Supports subject-relation-object tuples for knowledge linking | Medium |
| FR-23 | UKF Content Composers | Allows multiple text representations of knowledge content | Medium |
| FR-24 | UKF Access Control | Implements user/authority tuples for permission management | Medium |
| FR-25 | UKF Lifecycle Management | Supports time-based expiration and manual deactivation | Medium |
| FR-26 | UKF Metadata Extensions | Allows custom metadata and runtime profile tracking | Low |

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Implementation Details | Priority |
|----|-------------|------------------------|-----------|
| NFR-04 | Documentation | Ensures UKF schema is well-documented | Medium |
| NFR-06 | Serialization Performance | Optimizes UKF serialization/deserialization speed | High |
| NFR-07 | Schema Validation | Provides robust Pydantic-based field validation | High |
| NFR-08 | Memory Efficiency | Minimizes memory footprint for large knowledge collections | Medium |
| NFR-09 | Hash Consistency | Ensures deterministic ID and content hash generation | High |

<br/>

### 2.3 Cross-Component Dependencies

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| KLStore | For persistent storage of UKF records |
| KLEngine | For retrieval and utilization of UKF records |
| Prompts | For template-to-UKF conversion |
