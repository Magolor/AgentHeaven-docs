> **Ask not what your agents can do for you, ask what you can do for your agents.**

AgentHeaven is **NOT** another agent framework; it's an approach to knowledge management designed for the era of AI.

The purpose of AgentHeaven is to provide everything **BEFORE** the agent acts, enabling agents to work in a friendly, context-rich environment, i.e., a "heaven" for agents.

It empowers you to build a agentic lifelong learning system for any data application, treating AI agents as capable human beings, and as our users.

## üöÄ Our Vision

Imagine a future where you and your agents can effortlessly integrate with diverse data sources, enabling seamless, intelligent access and management of your domain-specific knowledge and data. AgentHeaven makes this a reality by centering around the core concept of a **[Unified Knowledge Format (UKF)](../python-guide/ukf/index.md)**. This is a standardized way to represent domain knowledge, rules, and historical data, providing a single, consistent logical framework for all information in your databases. Simply pour your data as UKF, and it becomes instantly AI-ready.

Built upon the `BaseUKF`, the **[Knowledge Base (KLBase)](../python-guide/klbase.md)** is a configurable system where knowledge extraction, storage, search, and utilization are completely decoupled. This enables you to mix and match any backend to create custom knowledge management workflows. Want in-memory storage with vector search? Or disk storage with search through string automaton? What about a distributed database with a multi-agent system? The possibilities are limitless. Simply design your application-specific `KLBase`‚Äîdefining the data model, knowledge sources, and maintenance methods‚Äîand then seamlessly integrate any LLM or agent workflow with it. AgentHeaven creates a **stateful tool that evolves with your application** , enabling truly intelligent and adaptable systems.

After a `BaseUKF` is initialized, **Imitation is All You Need**: we believe that an empirical path towards AGI is through imitation. AgentHeaven provides a specific **[Imitator](../python-guide/imitator.md)** mechanism. It allows any function‚Äîwhether a piece of code, a human workflow, or an agentic process‚Äîto be monitored and recorded as experiences in the `KLBase`. Over time, the `Imitator` learns from these experiences to build a "mimic" of the original function, which can be used to automate tasks, reduce costs, and improve performance. This creates a powerful lifelong learning loop where agents continuously improve by observing and imitating, progressively handling more complex tasks while allowing humans to focus on what truly matters.

## ü§ù A Collaborative Ecosystem

AgentHeaven provides a wide range of connections to general utilities, including [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) as a unified interface for language model inference, [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for database systems, [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) for vector databases, and [FastMCP 2.0](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome/) for tools, etc.

AgentHeaven also recognizes that the most powerful systems are those that foster long-term collaboration between humans and AI agents. It includes intuitive methods for both humans and AI agents to view, edit, and manage the knowledge base together. The ultimate goal is to create a true heaven for AI agents to be born, live, grow, and thrive.
