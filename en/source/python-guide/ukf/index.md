# UKF (Unified Knowledge Format)

The Unified Knowledge Format (UKF) is a framework designed to standardize knowledge representation. It systematically organizes information from heterogeneous sources, such as database schemas, documents, and historical user queries, to enable convenient and automated long-term maintenance of knowledge within enterprise systems. As a universal protocol, UKF supports multiple storage backends (such as databases and file systems) and diverse search indexes, and provides additional features such as provenance tracking, version control, and knowledge base personalization.

Current UKF version: v1.0
